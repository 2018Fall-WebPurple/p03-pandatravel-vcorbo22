        <blockquote>"The “First Class” tour will pair you up with a knowledgeable expert guide that will take you through the design, history, guest, and experience. This historic ship full of rich history. It was fun walking around the creepy places and learning about them. Also, the tour was very worth it and I highly recommend coming here if you're into that kind of stuff. This is a must place to see. You will have a great experience." -Marget</blockquote>

    <h4>The History</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen Mary was a luxury ship that sailed Hollywood celebrities arocss the ocean to their destination. When World War II started, the ship was used as a troopship. During World War II, the ship was renamed The Grey Ghost. The ship collied into another ship, HMS Curacoa. During the collision, the HMS Curacoa was slicied in half. The Queen Mary had to leave the crew and the ship under the water to perish. After World War II, the ship was reused for its original purpose of transporting people across the ocean. Two decades later, the ship is being used as a floating haunted hotel Long Beach, California. It is waiting for people to visit.</p>

    <h4 id=Experience>The Haunted Experience</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RMS Queen Mary has tours that you can take around the ship and learn about the ships history. Some of the places the tour takes you include boiler room, the engine room, and the famous deck "B". The tours can take place during day and night. The night tour is the most popular. Tours are not the only thing you can do on the ship. The ship is a hotel. You can spend the night in one of the staterooms. The most haunted stateroom is B340. This stateroom is only open to the public for a short amount of time.</p>

<!-- Quote on the experience of the ship.-->
    <blockquote>"What an awesome experience. Took the family to tour and staied there overnight.  From start to finish, it was awesome! Parking is organized and hotel self-parking is closest lot and right across the street from ship. The box office opens early for guests so you're sure to get the tours you want, when you want them and as a hotel guest you'll get a discount. The staterooms were a wonderful step back in time, incredibly well kept, and the functional port hole windows that had a habaor view were amazing. The "Glory Day's" tour was great, as was the two 4-D movies about the Queen Mary and sharks. There are plenty of options for food and beverages with many different price points. We enjoyed exploring the ship on our own and the entire staff couldn't have been more friendly and knowledgeable.  It's fun to wake up on the Queen Mary!" -Sam</blockquote>

    <h4>Stateroom B340</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stateroom was used as a thrid class room when it was in its orginal use. The room when through some revenation from then. The stateroom is now three staterooms collied together. By the sound of it the room may seem luxurious, but it is far off. The room consits of simple room design and has a ghostly presance to it. There are quotes on the wall of peoples way to say what they witnessed paranormal acivity in the room. The manager of the hotel has gotten a lot of compiliants about the room. Some of the compiliants included hearing footsteps, faucets turning on by them self, toliets flushings on their own, and the feeling of people lying in bed next to them.</p>

    <blockquote>"My family and I were looking to do something in Long Beach that I couldn't do in the Detroit area and I was happy to find a tour on the Queen Mary. We went on "The Paranormal" tour and the "Glory Days" tour. We got a really nice sampler of what this ship must have been like. Both our hosts were lively and informative and I felt like I learned a lot. We walked all over the ship and could wander around between tours. This is definaly a place you need to go." -Mike.</blockquote>
